# Front-end-1-semester
This repository contains my student projects on the subject of front-end. This repository contains 8 practical works that includes:
1) LW01 and LW02 performs tasks dedicated to JavaScript;
2) LW03 performs tasks dedicated to JavaScript, HTML and CSS;
3) LW04 and LW05 performs tasks dedicated to jQuery;
4) LW06, LW07 and LW08 performs tasks dedicated to Angular (most tasks can work correctly in the browser, 
other browsers may have a problem with `CORS errors, Reason: CORS request not HTTP`).

This practical works were created during my fourth-year studies in 2017.
